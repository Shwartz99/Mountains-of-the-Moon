 motm.3.d:0 "While there are other cities under our dominion, the city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is by far the most important. It is here that merchants from all of West Africa come to exchange goods, for example by trading salt for gold. Since we have now accumulated a large amount of wealth, one of our army leaders has suggested to improve the walls that surround [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. It will cost us some money, but it will protect us from the armies of our neighbors."
