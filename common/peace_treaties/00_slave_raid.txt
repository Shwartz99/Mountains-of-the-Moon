# Completely scripted peace treaties are made here

# THIS is the Taker and FROM the Giver in all scopes unless otherwise stated

# This functionality was made to fully support modded subject types. It can probably also be used for other things, but has the following limitations: 
# These treaties don't support having a different Taker/Giver than the two countries that are negotiating.
# Nor do they support setting provinces (like cede province) or third party countries (like annull treaties) as targets.

# Example:
po_slave_raid = {
	# The following strings need localization: 
	#		"make_dummy_desc" (uses text processing, supporting bracket notation) ("[FROM.GetName] becomes a [THIS.GetName] Dummy")
	#		"CB_ALLOWED_make_dummy" (uses plain localization) ("Enforced Dumbness")
	#		"PEACE_make_dummy" (uses plain localization, but with support for $TAKER$, $TAKERS$, $GIVER$ and $GIVERS$) ("Become $TAKERS$ Dummy")
